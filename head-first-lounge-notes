Document Object Model or the browser creates an object
the DOM for short. 

Using JavaScript, you can interact with your
page by manipulating the DOM,

JavaScript is now the standard and default scripting language, so you can
remove the type attribute from your script tags too. Here’s what the new
script tag looks like without the type attribute:
 <script src="lounge.js"></script>

JavaScript interacts with your page through the DOM.

A JavaScript API is an “Application Programming Interface.” 
APIs make it possible to control all aspects of HTML5, 
like 2D drawing, video playback, and more.

The <script> and </script> tags surround the
JavaScript code. They tell the page that what’s
in them is JavaScript, not HTML. 
which basically seperates the Javascript code from HTML code

not just by making them meaningful, 
but also by using a letter (small or uppercase), 
an underscore character or a dollar sign.
example:
var thisIsNotaJoke; var _myvariable; var $importantvar;

Numeric expressions
(9 / 5) * tempC + 32 x-1
Math.random() * 10 2.123 + 3.2

Variables are containers for holding values.
